                Hi, I'm David - a 25-year-old software developer, university
                student, and lifelong fitness enthusiast from Austria. I built
                Lift as part of my master's thesis in computer science, with a
                singular focus: creating a training tool that respects both
                physiological principles and statistical rigor. This isn't a
                social platform or a motivational feed. It's a structured,
                data-driven system designed for lifters who take their training
                seriously and want to understand their progress beyond
                surface-level metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
                My background in data science and machine learning shaped how I
                approached this project. I wanted to build something that could
                translate raw training data into meaningful insights—not through
                flashy animations or arbitrary gamification, but through
                well-designed charts, robust statistical methods, and thoughtful
                progression logic. Lift is opinionated by design. It doesn't try
                to be everything to everyone. Instead, it focuses on resistance
                training, hypertrophy-oriented programming, and the principles
                that actually drive long-term progress.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Lift Exists</h2>
            <p>
                I created Lift because existing workout apps frustrated me. Many
                were web-based or poorly designed, cluttered with social
                features I didn't need, or too flexible to provide meaningful
                structure. Others tracked numbers but offered no real insight
                into what those numbers meant or how to improve them. I wanted
                something different: a native iOS app that felt clean and
                intentional, that integrated deeply with Apple Health, and that
                could help intermediate to advanced lifters understand and
                systematically improve their training.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core philosophy is simple: progressive overload,
                auto-regulation, and periodization. Consistency matters, but so
                does structure. Training without a plan leads to spinning your
                wheels. Training with a plan—but without feedback
                mechanisms—leads to stagnation or burnout. Lift aims to solve
                both problems by providing structure upfront and adapting over
                time based on your performance and feedback.
            </p>

            <h2>What Makes Lift Different</h2>
            <p>
                Lift is built around several key principles that distinguish it
                from other tracking apps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>RIR as a first-class metric:</strong> Reps in
                    Reserve (RIR) is integrated directly into the workout flow,
                    not buried in settings. It's central to understanding effort
                    and driving auto-regulated progression.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bodyweight-aware performance tracking:</strong> Lift
                    reads bodyweight from Apple Health, applies Kalman filtering
                    to smooth out noise, and incorporates bodyweight into
                    performance calculations. If you're performing dips at a
                    higher bodyweight, that counts as real strength progress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mesocycle planning:</strong> Rather than leaving you
                    to figure out splits and volumes on your own, Lift generates
                    structured training plans based on your experience level,
                    available training days, and muscle-group priorities. It
                    then tracks your progress through the mesocycle and adjusts
                    variables automatically.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Auto-regulated progression:</strong> After each
                    exercise, you provide feedback on effort, pain, and volume
                    tolerance. Lift uses this to adjust training
                    variables—reducing RIR, increasing load, adding reps or
                    sets, or introducing deloads when needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Smart warm-ups:</strong> The app can generate
                    warm-up sets automatically using percentile-based analysis
                    of your recent performance, preparing you effectively
                    without pre-exhausting you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Robust strength estimates:</strong> Instead of
                    relying on single best lifts, Lift computes 1RIR and 1RM
                    estimates across multiple sessions and applies statistical
                    filtering to produce stable, realistic numbers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rich data visualization:</strong> Charts and
                    statistics aren't decoration—they're tools to understand
                    training streaks, consistency, volume distribution,
                    bodyweight trends, and performance trajectory over time.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All of this runs natively on iOS using SwiftUI. The interface is
                clean, minimal, and interruption-free. There are no accounts, no
                ads, and no social feeds. Your data stays on your device. You
                can use Lift fully offline, and you own your information
                completely.
            </p>

            <h2>The Research Component</h2>
            <p>
                Lift is part of my master's thesis, and I'm actively collecting
                anonymized training data to advance scientific understanding of
                resistance training. If you choose to participate, you can
                donate your workout logs and questionnaire responses through an
                optional feature in the app. This data is encrypted, stored
                securely on a server in Zurich, and stripped of all personal
                identifying information. Only an anonymous device identifier is
                used to correlate logs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Participation is entirely optional. You can use Lift without
                ever contributing data. But if you do participate, you're
                helping to build better models, uncover insights into training
                response, and improve the app for everyone. This research will
                form the foundation of my thesis and potentially lead to
                on-device machine learning features that offer more personalized
                recommendations over time.
            </p>

            <h2>Who This App Is For</h2>
            <p>
                Lift is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters who train
                consistently, value structure, and prefer data-driven
                decision-making over guesswork. If you're the kind of person who
                cares about progressive overload, understands what RIR means,
                and wants to see your training improve systematically rather
                than randomly, this app is for you. Beginners can use Lift for
                basic tracking, but many of its features—mesocycle planning,
                auto-regulation, statistical analysis—are built for users who
                are willing to engage seriously with their training process.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not a casual logging app. It's not a motivational
                platform. It's a tool for people who want clarity, structure,
                and confidence in their training decisions.
            </p>

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>
                Lift is actively evolving. I'm working on improved progression
                algorithms, on-device machine learning models, exercise
                recommendations, widgets, and deeper platform integrations. The
                app is currently free to use, and there are no plans to
                introduce subscriptions within the next one to two years. User
                feedback is not only welcomed—it's essential. As the system
                matures, breaking changes may occur, but the core philosophy
                will remain the same: scientifically grounded, user-owned, and
                built for progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for using Lift. Whether you're tracking your first
                mesocycle or refining years of training data, your commitment to
                structured improvement is what makes this project meaningful.
