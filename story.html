            <p>
                Hi, I’m David—a 25-year-old software developer, university
                student, and lifelong fitness enthusiast from Austria. My
                journey with this app began not just with lines of code, but
                with a deep conviction: physical fitness is one of the greatest
                investments you can make in your life. It transforms not only
                your body, but also your mind, your confidence, and the way you
                move through the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                As someone who’s passionate about data science and machine
                learning, I’ve always been fascinated by the stories that data
                can tell. I believe that with enough information and the right
                tools, we can unlock new levels of understanding and
                progress—both in science and in our personal lives. The recent
                surge in generative AI is proof of how a breakthrough, combined
                with existing knowledge, can disrupt entire industries. But for
                me, the most exciting potential lies in helping real people
                achieve real results.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This App Exists</h2>
            <p>
                I created this app because I saw a gap in the fitness world.
                Social media is full of conflicting advice, sacred exercises,
                and endless trends. But for most people, the real key to
                progress isn’t hidden knowledge—it’s consistency. Week after
                week. Month after month. Year after year. As James Clear says,
                “It’s not that hard on any given day, but the trick is you can’t
                skip days.” Reasonable, regular effort beats sporadic intensity
                every time.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal was to build a tool that makes scientifically-based
                fitness accessible to everyone—without requiring endless
                research or guesswork. I wanted to create something that
                empowers you to track your progress, understand your strengths,
                and make smarter decisions in the gym. Whether you’re a beginner
                or a seasoned lifter, this app is designed to support your
                journey and help you stay consistent.
            </p>

            <h2>What Makes This App Different</h2>
            <p>
                From the start, I focused on putting the user first. Your data
                stays on your device—private, secure, and fully under your
                control. There’s no third-party tracking, no hidden data
                sharing. You can export, clear, or delete your information at
                any time. The app is built around your needs, with features
                like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Comprehensive workout tracking—log exercises, weights, reps,
                    and more
                </li>
                <li>
                    Personalized analytics and trend estimations to help you see
                    your progress
                </li>
                <li>Smart recommendations and customizable routines</li>
                <li>
                    Streaks, reminders, and motivational insights to keep you on
                    track
                </li>
                <li>
                    Internationalization and accessibility for a global
                    community
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                But this is just the beginning. My vision is to create a
                platform that not only tracks your workouts, but also learns
                from your data—offering tailored advice, smarter training
                cycles, and advanced recovery metrics. In the next phases, I’ll
                be integrating expert systems and AI-driven recommendations to
                help you train even more effectively.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Role in This Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Here’s where you come in. As a user, you’re not just benefiting
                from the app—you’re helping to shape its future. In about a
                year, I’ll be inviting users to donate their anonymized workout
                data for scientific research. This data will be the foundation
                of my master thesis in computer science, enabling me to develop
                better models, uncover new insights, and improve the app for
                everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your participation is crucial. By using the app and (optionally)
                contributing your data, you’re helping to advance scientific
                understanding of fitness and human performance. Together, we can
                build tools that empower people everywhere to train smarter,
                stay healthier, and reach their goals.
            </p>

            <h2>Fitness Is More Than Just Muscle</h2>
            <p>
                I believe that being fit isn’t just about looking good—it’s
                about living well. It’s about the confidence you carry, the
                standards you set, and the example you lead for others. The gym
                teaches us about failure, resilience, and growth. It humbles us,
                breaks us down, and builds us back up. Your progress is a direct
                reflection of your effort—there’s no luck involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                I train for my family, for my future, and for the peace it
                brings me. I hope this app helps you find your own reasons to
                stay consistent, to push forward, and to become the best version
                of yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for being part of this journey. Your commitment, your
                feedback, and your trust are what make this project possible.
                Together, we’re not just building stronger bodies—we’re building
                a stronger community.
            </p>
