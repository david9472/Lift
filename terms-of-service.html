            <p>
                <strong>Before beginning any exercise program</strong>, you
                should consult with appropriate healthcare professionals to
                ensure that it is safe for you to do so. This is particularly
                important if you have any pre-existing health conditions,
                injuries, or other medical concerns.
            </p>
            <h3>4.3 Assumption of Risk</h3>

                <li>
                    You assume all known and unknown risks associated with any

                    if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction, or
                    negligence of Lift or others.
                </li>
                <li>
