            <h1>About Support ID</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                Support ID is a code your device creates when you choose to
                share App Analytics. It lets Support locate the diagnostic logs
                your app has already sent, so issues you report can be
                investigated faster and more accurately.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Support ID</strong> connects your support request to
                    existing, anonymous diagnostics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Support ID</strong> does not identify you
                    personally.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>

            <p>To use Support ID, you need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The app installed and able to access its Settings.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Share App Analytics</strong> turned on in your app
                    settings.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> If you do not share App Analytics, a
                    Support ID will not be created.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Find and Share Your Support ID</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Open the app.</li>
                <li>Go to <strong>Account</strong>.</li>
                <li>Tap <strong>Data & Storage</strong>.</li>
                <li>Find <strong>Support ID</strong>.</li>
                <li>
                    When you contact Support, provide the Support ID exactly as
                    shown.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <strong>Tip:</strong> Tab the Support ID to
                <strong>copy</strong> it and avoid transcription errors.
            </p>

            <h2>What Support ID Is Not</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    It does not contain your name, email, Apple ID, or any
                    personal details.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It cannot be used to track you across different apps or
                    services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It changes if you delete and reinstall the app. Past data
                    cannot be linked to new installations.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Support ID Is Created</h2>

            <p>
                To keep Support ID stable for troubleshooting and private for
                your identity, the app uses a multi-step process:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Start with a system-provided, app-scoped device identifier.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generate a random, app-specific salt (a secret value used
                    once), stored only on your device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine the identifier and salt, then process them with a
                    strong cryptographic hash function (a one-way algorithm).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shorten the result into the Support ID shown in the app's
                    Settings.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>This design ensures:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Support ID looks different from the underlying system
                    identifier.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The process cannot be reversed to reveal your device or
                    personal information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reinstalling the app creates a new salt and a new Support
                    ID, preventing links to prior installations.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Privacy by Design</h2>

            <p>By design, your Support ID is:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Anonymous</strong>: it cannot be traced back to you
                    personally.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Non-persistent across reinstalls</strong>: each
                    installation creates a new Support ID.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Purpose-limited</strong>: used only to match your
                    request to diagnostic logs for troubleshooting.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These protections are repeated here for clarity: Support ID is
                anonymous, it resets on reinstall, and it is used only for
                support.
            </p>

            <h2>Reinstalling the App</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you delete and reinstall the app, your Support ID
                    changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After reinstall, provide the new Support ID when you contact
                    Support.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Previous Support IDs cannot be connected to the new
                    installation.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

            <h3>If you can't find Support ID in the app:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Update the app to the latest version.</li>
                <li>Check <strong>Account > Data & Storage</strong>.</li>
                <li>Contact Support and describe where you looked.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If Support can't locate your logs with the ID you provided:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Confirm that <strong>Share App Analytics</strong> is turned
                    on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Verify you're reading the Support ID from the same device
                    and app installation where the issue occurred.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Turn on Share App Analytics:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    On your device, go to
                    <strong>Account > Data & Storage > Analytics</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>Turn on <strong>Share App Analytics</strong>.</li>
                <li>
                    If prompted, restart the app (close it completely and reopen
                    it).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return to
                    <strong>Account > Data & Storage > Analytics</strong> to
                    view your Support ID.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>After reinstall:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Expect a new Support ID.</li>
                <li>
                    If you had an existing support case, share your new Support
                    ID.
                </li>
            </ul>
